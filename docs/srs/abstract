Meet-Riders is a travel-sharing application designed exclusively for the university and office community. Its primary objective is to transform the daily commute into a safer, more economical, and social experience for the users. The application addresses the challenges of transportation to and from campus by creating a trusted platform where users can connect with peers traveling in the same direction.
Meet-Riders is a comprehensive travel-sharing solution that extends beyond traditional carpooling. It supports various modes of transport, including driving, public transit, cycling, and walking, allowing users to create or join travel "parties." Key features include a robust student verification system using official university email addresses, detailed user profiles and in-app group chat for seamless coordination.
To ensure user safety, the application incorporates real-time trip tracking, an emergency contact button, and the ability to share trip status with external contacts. For carpooling, an integrated payment system automates cost-splitting for expenses like gas and tolls. The system is being developed with a frontend built on Next.js and a backend powered by the Java Spring Framework. The ultimate goal is to foster a collaborative community that reduces traffic congestion, promotes eco-friendly travel, and builds new connections among students.
